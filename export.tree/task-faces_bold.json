   "TaskDescription": "In a block design, participants were shown happy, angry, or neutral faces from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) database. Each block was 20 seconds long and contained 20 faces, each shown for 0.5 seconds. Blocks were arranged in sets of three beginning and ending with the same emotion, and with neutral in the middle (happy-neutral-happy or angry-neutral-angry). After each set of three, participants were asked to rate how happy and angry they felt on a visual analog scale of 0-100.",
